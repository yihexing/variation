    food of love

   <br> I’m going to murder you with love;
<br>I’m going to suffocate you with embraces;
<br>I’m going to hug you, bone by bone,
<br>Till you’re dead all over.
<br>Then I will dine on your delectable marrow.
 
<br>You will become my personal Sahara;
<br>I’ll sun myself in you, then with one swallow
<br>Drain your remaining brackish well.
<br>With my female blade I’ll carve my name
<br>In your most aspiring palm
<br>Before I chop it down.
<br>Then I’ll inhale your last oasis whole.
 
<br>But in the total desert you become
<br>You’ll see me stretch, horizon to horizon,
<br>Opulent mirage!
<br>Wisteria balconies dripping cyclamen.
<br>Vistas ablaze with crystal, laced in gold.
 
<br>So you will summon each dry grain of sand
<br>And move toward me in undulating dunes
<br>Till you arrive at sudden ultramarine:
<br>A Mediterranean to stroke your dusty shores;
<br>Obstinate verdure, creeping inland, fast renudes
<br>Your barrens; succulents spring up everywhere,
<br>Surprising life! And I will be that green.
 
<br>When you are fed and watered, flourishing
<br>With shoots entwining trellis, dome, and spire,
<br>Till you are resurrected field in bloom,
<br>I will devour you, my natural food,
<br>My host, my final supper on the earth,
<br>And you’ll begin to die again.﻿
