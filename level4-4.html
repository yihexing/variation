    <h1> <p>I’m going to murder you with love;</p> </h1>
    <p>I’m going to suffocate you with embraces;</p>
    <p>I’m going to hug you, bone by bone,</p>
    <p>Till you’re dead all over.</p>
    <p>Then I will dine on your delectable marrow.</p>
     
    <h2><p>You will become my personal Sahara;</p></h2>
    <p>I’ll sun myself in you, then with one swallow
        Drain your remaining brackish well.</p>
    <p>With my female blade I’ll carve my name</p>
    <p>In your most aspiring palm</p>
    <p>Before I chop it down.</p>
    <p>Then I’ll inhale your last oasis whole.</p>
     
    <h3><p>But in the total desert you become</p></h3>
    <p>You’ll see me stretch, horizon to horizon,
        Opulent mirage!</p>
    <p>Wisteria balconies dripping cyclamen.</p>
    <p>Vistas ablaze with crystal, laced in gold.</p>
     
    <h4><p>So you will summon each dry grain of sand</p></h4>
    <p>And move toward me in undulating dunes</p>
    <p>Till you arrive at sudden ultramarine:</p>
    <p>A Mediterranean to stroke your dusty shores;</p>
    <p>Obstinate verdure, creeping inland, fast renudes</p>
    <p>Your barrens; succulents spring up everywhere,</p>
    <p>Surprising life! And I will be that green.</p>
     
    <h5><p>When you are fed and watered, flourishing</p></h5>
    <p>With shoots entwining trellis, dome, and spire,</p>
    <p>Till you are resurrected field in bloom,</p>
    <p>I will devour you, my natural food,</p>
    <p>My host, my final supper on the earth,</p>
    <p>And you’ll begin to die again.﻿</p>
