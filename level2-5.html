   <div>I’m going to murder you with love;</div> 
<h2><p>I’m going to suffocate you with embraces;</p></h2>
<p>I’m going to hug you, bone by bone,</p>
<p>Till you’re dead all over.</p>
<p>Then I will dine on your delectable marrow.</p>
 
<p>You will become my personal Sahara;</p>
<p>I’ll sun myself in you, then with one swallow
    Drain your remaining brackish well.</p>
<p>With my female blade I’ll carve my name</p>
<p>In your most aspiring palm</p>
<p>Before I chop it down.</p>
<p>Then I’ll inhale your last oasis whole.</p>
 
<h3><p>I’m going to suffocate you with embraces;</p></h3>
<p>You’ll see me stretch, horizon to horizon,
    Opulent mirage!</p>
<p>Wisteria balconies dripping cyclamen.</p>
<p>Vistas ablaze with crystal, laced in gold.</p>
 
<p>So you will summon each dry grain of sand</p>
<p>And move toward me in undulating dunes</p>
<p>Till you arrive at sudden ultramarine:</p>
<p>A Mediterranean to stroke your dusty shores;</p>
<p>Obstinate verdure, creeping inland, fast renudes</p>
<p>Your barrens; succulents spring up everywhere,</p>
<p>Surprising life! And I will be that green.</p>
 
<p>When you are fed and watered, flourishing</p>
<p>With shoots entwining trellis, dome, and spire,</p>
<p>Till you are resurrected field in bloom,</p>
<p>I will devour you, my natural food,</p>
<p>My host, my final supper on the earth,</p>
<p>And you’ll begin to die again.﻿</p>
